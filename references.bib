	abstract = {Practical quantum computers require a large network of highly coherent qubits, interconnected in a design robust against errors. Donor spins in silicon provide state-of-the-art coherence and quantum gate fidelities, in a platform adapted from industrial semiconductor processing. Here we present a scalable design for a silicon quantum processor that does not require precise donor placement and leaves ample space for the routing of interconnects and readout devices. We introduce the flip-flop qubit, a combination of the electron-nuclear spin states of a phosphorus donor that can be controlled by microwave electric fields. Two-qubit gates exploit a second-order electric dipole-dipole interaction, allowing selective coupling beyond the nearest-neighbor, at separations of hundreds of nanometers, while microwave resonators can extend the entanglement to macroscopic distances. We predict gate fidelities within fault-tolerance thresholds using realistic noise models. This design provides a realizable blueprint for scalable spin-based quantum computers in silicon.},

Specifically, it is shown that when the input alphabet size is a prime number, a similar construction to that for the binary case leads to polarization. This method can be extended to channels of composite input alphabet sizes by decomposing such channels into a set of channels with prime input alphabet sizes. It is also shown that all discrete memoryless channels can be polarized by randomized constructions. The introduction of randomness does not change the order of complexity of polar code construction, encoding, and decoding. A previous result on the error probability behavior of polar codes is also extended to the case of arbitrary discrete memoryless channels. The generalization of polarization to channels with arbitrary finite input alphabet sizes leads to polar-coding methods for approaching the true (as opposed to symmetric) channel capacity of arbitrary channels with discrete or continuous input alphabets.},

	abstract = {Polar codes were recently introduced by Arikan. They achieve the symmetric capacity of arbitrary binary-input discrete memoryless channels under a low complexity successive cancellation decoding scheme. The original polar code construction is closely related to the recursive construction of Reed-Muller codes and is based on the 2 × 2 matrix [1 0 : 1 1]. It was shown by Arikan Telatar that this construction achieves an error exponent of 1/2, i.e., that for sufficiently large blocklengths the error probability decays exponentially in the square root of the blocklength. It was already mentioned by Arikan that in principle larger matrices can be used to construct polar codes. In this paper, it is first shown that any ℓ × ℓ matrix none of whose column permutations is upper triangular polarizes binary-input memoryless channels. The exponent of a given square matrix is characterized, upper and lower bounds on achievable exponents are given. Using these bounds it is shown that there are no matrices of size smaller than 15×15 with exponents exceeding 1/2. Further, a general construction based on BCH codes which for large I achieves exponents arbitrarily close to 1 is given. At size 16 × 16, this construction yields an exponent greater than 1/2.},

In this paper, we improve upon our conference proceedings formulation and upon the Shih-Hsu PC-tree, both of which perform comprehensive tests of planarity conditions embedding the edges from a vertex to its descendants in a ‘batch’ vertex addition operation. These tests are simpler than but analogous to the templating scheme of the PQ-tree. Instead, we take the edge to be the fundamental unit of addition to the partial embedding while preserving planarity. This eliminates the batch planarity condition testing in favor of a few localized decisions of a path traversal process, and it exploits the fact that subgraphs can become biconnected by adding a single edge. Our method is presented using only graph constructs, but our deﬁnition of external activity, path traversal process and theoretical analysis of correctness can be applied to optimize the PC-tree as well.},

The rectilinear crossing number of a graph G, cr‾(G), is the minimum number of pairs of crossing edges in any straight-line drawing of G. Determining or estimating cr‾(G) appears to be a difficult problem, and deciding if cr‾(G)≤k is known to be NP-hard. In fact, the asymptotic behavior of cr‾(Kn) is still unknown. In this paper, we present a deterministic n2+o(1)-time algorithm that finds a straight-line drawing of any n-vertex graph G with cr‾(G)+o(n4) pairs of crossing edges. Together with the well-known Crossing Lemma due to Ajtai et al. and Leighton, this result implies that for any dense n-vertex graph G, one can efficiently find a straight-line drawing of G with (1+o(1))cr‾(G) pairs of crossing edges.},

The multiple edge insertion problem (MEI) asks for a drawing of G + F with the minimum number of pairwise edge crossings, such that the subdrawing of G is plane. Finding an exact solution to MEI is NP-hard for general F. We present the ﬁrst polynomial time algorithm for MEI that achieves an additive approximation guarantee—depending only on the size of F and the maximum degree of G, in the case of connected G. Our algorithm seems to be the ﬁrst directly implementable one in that realm, too, next to the single edge insertion. It is also known that an (even approximate) solution to the MEI problem would approximate the crossing number of the F-almost-planar graph G + F, while computing the crossing number of G + F exactly is NP-hard already when {\textbar}F{\textbar} = 1. Hence our algorithm induces new, improved approximation bounds for the crossing number problem of F-almost-planar graphs, achieving constant-factor approximation for the large class of such graphs of bounded degrees and bounded size of F.},

Such biased noise, where dephasing dominates, is ubiquitous in many quantum architectures. In the limit of pure dephasing noise we find a threshold of 43.7(1)\% using a tensor network decoder proposed by Bravyi, Suchara and Vargo. The threshold remains surprisingly large in the regime of realistic noise bias ratios, for example 28.2(2)\% at a bias of 10. The performance is in fact at or near the hashing bound for all values of the bias. The modified surface code still uses only weight-4 stabilizers on a square lattice, but merely requires measuring products of Y instead of Z around the faces, as this doubles the number of useful syndrome bits associated with the dominant Z errors. Our results demonstrate that large efficiency gains can be found by appropriately tailoring codes and decoders to realistic noise models, even under the locality constraints of topological codes.},

A useful general, preliminary result obtained here is Theorem 8: a planar graph has a planar representation for any arbitrary placement of its nodes in the plane. It is then proved that if we have positive integers D and T, such that any graph of degree at most D has thickness at most T, the following hold. Theorem 9: Any graph of degree d has thickness at most T roof\{(d + 1)D\}. Theorem 10: Any graph of degree d can always be embedded in a regular graph G° of any degree ƒ ⩾ d. Corollary 5: Any graph of degree d has thickness at most roof(d2). Theorem 12: With D and T defined as above, we have D ⩽ 4T − 2; Corollary 6: If T = 2, then D ⩽ 6. We further conjecture that, indeed, the thickness of any graph of degree not exceeding 6 is never more than 2; and that, more generally, T = roof\{(D + 2)4)\}. Since the design and fabrication of VLSI computer chips is essentially a concrete representation of the planar decomposition of a graph, all these results are of direct practical interest.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of decoding sparse quantum error correction codes. For Pauli channels, this task can be accomplished by a version of the belief propagation algorithm used for decoding sparse classical codes. Quantum codes pose two new challenges however. Firstly, their Tanner graph unavoidably contain small loops which typically undermines the performance of belief propagation. Secondly, sparse quantum codes are by definition highly degenerate. The standard belief propagation algorithm does not exploit this feature, but rather it is impaired by it. We propose heuristic methods to improve belief propagation decoding, specifically targeted at these two problems. While our results exhibit a clear improvement due to the proposed heuristic methods, they also indicate that the main source of errors in the quantum coding scheme remains in the decoding.},

When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixedj. A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. Forj {\textgreater} 3and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length.

	abstract = {This paper proves the threshold result, which asserts that quantum computation can be made robust against errors and inaccuracies, when the error rate, \${\textbackslash}textbackslasheta\$, is smaller than a constant threshold, \${\textbackslash}textbackslasheta\_c\$. The result holds for a very general, not necessarily probabilistic noise model, for quantum particles with any number of states, and is also generalized to one dimensional quantum computers with only nearest neighbor interactions. No measurements, or classical operations, are required during the quantum computation. The proceeding version was very succinct, and here we fill all the missing details, and elaborate on many parts of the proof. In particular, we devote a section for a discussion of universality issues and proofs that the sets of gates that we use are universal. Another section is devoted to a rigorous proof that fault tolerance can be achieved in the presence of general non probabilistic noise. The systematic structure of the fault tolerant procedures for polynomial codes is explained in length. The proof that the concatenation scheme works is written in a clearer way. The paper also contains new and significantly simpler proofs for most of the known results which we use. For example, we give a simple proof that it suffices to correct bit and phase flips, we significantly simplify Calderbank and Shor's original proof of the correctness of CSS codes. We also give a simple proof of the fact that two-qubit gates are universal. The paper thus provides a self contained and complete proof for universal fault tolerant quantum computation.},

These techniques are nearly universally employed in modern communication systems, and are thus an important component of the modern information economy. Error Correction Coding: Mathematical Methods and Algorithms provides a comprehensive introduction to both the theoretical and practical aspects of error correction coding, with a presentation suitable for a wide variety of audiences, including graduate students in electrical engineering, mathematics, or computer science. The pedagogy is arranged so that the mathematical concepts are presented incrementally, followed immediately by applications to coding. A large number of exercises expand and deepen students' understanding. A unique feature of the book is a set of programming laboratories, supplemented with over 250 programs and functions on an associated Web site, which provides hands-on experience and a better understanding of the material. These laboratories lead students through the implementation and evaluation of Hamming codes, CRC codes, BCH and R-S codes, convolutional codes, turbo codes, and LDPC codes. This text offers both "classical" coding theory-such as Hamming, BCH, Reed-Solomon, Reed-Muller, and convolutional codes-as well as modern codes and decoding methods, including turbo codes, LDPC codes, repeat-accumulate codes, space time codes, factor graphs, soft-decision decoding, Guruswami-Sudan decoding, EXIT charts, and iterative decoding. Theoretical complements on performance and bounds are presented. Coding is also put into its communications and information theoretic context and connections are drawn to public key cryptosystems. Ideal as a classroom resource and a professional reference, this thorough guide will benefit electrical and computer engineers, mathematicians, students, researchers, and scientists.},

We derive the sufficient, and in some cases also the necessary, conditions for each construction to satisfy the general symplectic inner product (SIP) condition, and develop practical decoder algorithms for these codes.

Recently, this code family was extended by replacing the block-structured polarization step of polar codes by a convolutional structure. This article presents a numerical exploration of this so-called convolutional polar codes family to find efficient generalizations of polar codes, both in terms of decoding speed and decoding error probability. The main conclusion drawn from our study is that increasing the convolution depth is more efficient than increasing the polarization kernel's breadth as previously explored.},

	abstract = {Arikan's Polar codes attracted much attention as the first efficiently decodable and capacity achieving codes. Furthermore, Polar codes exhibit an exponentially decreasing block error probability with an asymptotic error exponent upper bounded by 1/2. Since their discovery, many attempts have been made to improve the error exponent and the finite block-length performance, while keeping the bloc-structured kernel. Recently, two of us introduced a new family of efficiently decodable error-correction codes based on a recently discovered efficiently-contractible tensor network family in quantum many-body physics, called branching MERA. These codes, called branching MERA codes, include Polar codes and also extend them in a non-trivial way by substituting the bloc-structured kernel by a convolutional structure. Here, we perform an in-depth study of a particular example that can be thought of as a direct extension to Arikan's Polar code, which we therefore name Convolutional Polar codes. We prove that these codes polarize and exponentially suppress the channel's error probability, with an asymptotic error exponent log\_2(3)/2 which is provably better than for Polar codes under successive cancellation decoding. We also perform finite block-size numerical simulations which display improved error-correcting capability with only a minor impact on decoding complexity.},

This improves on the polylogarithmic overhead promised by the standard threshold theorem. To achieve this, we exploit a framework introduced by Gottesman together with a family of constant rate quantum codes, quantum expander codes. Our main technical contribution is to analyze an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes and prove that it remains robust in the presence of noisy syndrome measurements, a property which is crucial for fault-tolerant circuits. We also establish two additional features of the decoding algorithm that make it attractive for quantum computation: it can be parallelized to run in logarithmic depth, and is single-shot, meaning that it only requires a single round of noisy syndrome measurement.},

	abstract = {A method is proposed, called channel polarization, to construct code sequences that achieve the symmetric capacity I(W) of any given binary-input discrete memoryless channel (B-DMC) W. The symmetric capacity is the highest rate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal probability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to synthesize, out of N independent copies of a given B-DMC W, a second set of N binary-input channels WN(i)1 les i les N such that, as N becomes large, the fraction of indices i for which I(WN(i)) is near 1 approaches I(W) and the fraction for which I(WN(i)) is near 0 approaches 1-I(W). The polarized channels WN(i) are well-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate 1 through those with capacity near 1 and at rate 0 through the remaining. Codes constructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes. The paper proves that, given any B-DMC W with I(W) {\textbackslash}textgreater 0 and any target rate R{\textbackslash}textless I(W) there exists a sequence of polar codes Cfrn;nges1 such that Cfrn has block-length N=2n , rate ges R, and probability of block error under successive cancellation decoding bounded as Pe(N,R) les O(N-1/4) independently of the code rate. This performance is achievable by encoders and decoders with complexity O(N logN) for each.},

	abstract = {Hypergraph product codes are a class of constant-rate quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes equipped with a linear-time decoder called small-set-flip (SSF). This decoder displays sub-optimal performance in practice and requires very large error correcting codes to be effective. In this work, we present new hybrid decoders that combine the belief propagation (BP) algorithm with the SSF decoder. We present the results of numerical simulations when codes are subject to independent bit-flip and phase-flip errors. We provide evidence that the threshold of these codes is roughly 7.5\% assuming an ideal syndrome extraction, and remains close to 3\% in the presence of syndrome noise. This result subsumes and significantly improves upon an earlier work by Grospellier and Krishna (arXiv:1810.03681). The low-complexity high-performance of these heuristic decoders suggests that decoding should not be a substantial difficulty when moving from zero-rate surface codes to constant-rate LDPC codes and gives a further hint that such codes are well-worth investigating in the context of building large universal quantum computers.},

	abstract = {We present and analyze protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computing using color codes. We present circuit-level schemes for extracting the error syndrome of these codes fault-tolerantly. We further present an integer-program-based decoding algorithm for identifying the most likely error given the syndrome. We simulated our syndrome extraction and decoding algorithms against three physically-motivated noise models using Monte Carlo methods, and used the simulations to estimate the corresponding accuracy thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum error correction. We also used a self-avoiding walk analysis to lower-bound the accuracy threshold for two of these noise models. We present and analyze two architectures for fault-tolerantly computing with these codes: one with 2D arrays of qubits are stacked atop each other and one in a single 2D substrate. Our analysis demonstrates that color codes perform slightly better than Kitaev's surface codes when circuit details are ignored. When these details are considered, we estimate that color codes achieve a threshold of 0.082(3)\%, which is higher than the threshold of \$1.3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ achieved by concatenated coding schemes restricted to nearest-neighbor gates in two dimensions but lower than the threshold of 0.75\% to 1.1\% reported for the Kitaev codes subject to the same restrictions. Finally, because the behavior of our decoder's performance for two of the noise models we consider maps onto an order-disorder phase transition in the three-body random-bond Ising model in 2D and the corresponding random-plaquette gauge model in 3D, our results also answer the Nishimori conjecture for these models in the negative: the statistical-mechanical classical spin systems associated to the 4.8.8 color codes are counterintuitively more ordered at positive temperature than at zero temperature.},

	abstract = {The computational cost of counting the number of solutions satisfying a Boolean formula, which is a problem instance of \#SAT, has proven subtle to quantify. Even when finding individual satisfying solutions is computationally easy (e.g. 2-SAT, which is in \$\${\textbackslash}mathsf\{\{P\}\}\$\$), determining the number of solutions can be \#\$\${\textbackslash}mathsf\{\{P\}\}\$\$-hard. Recently, computational methods simulating quantum systems experienced advancements due to the development of tensor network algorithms and associated quantum physics-inspired techniques. By these methods, we give an algorithm using an axiomatic tensor contraction language for n-variable \#SAT instances with complexity \$\$O((g+cd){\textasciicircum}\{O(1)\} 2{\textasciicircum}c)\$\$where c is the number of COPY-tensors, g is the number of gates, and d is the maximal degree of any COPY-tensor. Thus, n-variable counting problems can be solved efficiently when their tensor network expression has at most \$\$O({\textbackslash}log n)\$\$COPY-tensors and polynomial fan-out. This framework also admits an intuitive proof of a variant of the Tovey conjecture (the r,1-SAT instance of the Dubois–Tovey theorem). This study increases the theory, expressiveness and application of tensor based algorithmic tools and provides an alternative insight on these problems which have a long history in statistical physics and computer science.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2109.14599},
	abstract = {In this work we establish lower bounds on the size of Clifford circuits that measure a family of commuting Pauli operators. Our bounds depend on the interplay between a pair of graphs: the Tanner graph of the set of measured Pauli operators, and the connectivity graph which represents the qubit connections required to implement the circuit. For local-expander quantum codes, which are promising for low-overhead quantum error correction, we prove that any syndrome extraction circuit implemented with local Clifford gates in a 2D square patch of \$N\$ qubits has depth at least \${\textbackslash}Omega(n/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{N\})\$ where \$n\$ is the code length. Then, we propose two families of quantum circuits saturating this bound. First, we construct 2D local syndrome extraction circuits for quantum LDPC codes with bounded depth using only \$O(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$ ancilla qubits. Second, we design a family of 2D local syndrome extraction circuits for hypergraph product codes using \$O(n)\$ ancilla qubits with depth \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\})\$. Finally, we use circuit noise simulations to compare the performance of a family of hypergraph product codes using this last family of 2D syndrome extraction circuits with a syndrome extraction circuit implemented with fully connected qubits. While there is a threshold of about \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ for a fully connected implementation, we observe no threshold for the 2D local implementation despite simulating error rates of as low as \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$. This suggests that quantum LDPC codes are impractical with 2D local quantum hardware. We believe that our proof technique is of independent interest and could find other applications. Our bounds on circuit sizes are derived from a lower bound on the amount of correlations between two subsets of qubits of the circuit and an upper bound on the amount of correlations introduced by each circuit gate, which together provide a lower bound on the circuit size.},

This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme ‘hardness’, computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.},

Here, we use ensembles of low-depth random circuits with local connectivity in D≥1 spatial dimensions to generate quantum error-correcting codes. For random stabilizer codes and the erasure channel, we find strong evidence that a depth O(logN) random circuit is necessary and sufficient to converge (with high probability) to zero failure probability for any finite amount below the optimal erasure threshold, set by the channel capacity, for any D. Previous results on random circuits have only shown that O(N1/D) depth suffices or that O(log3N) depth suffices for all-to-all connectivity (D→∞). We then study the critical behavior of the erasure threshold in the so-called moderate deviation limit, where both the failure probability and the distance to the optimal threshold converge to zero with N. We find that the requisite depth scales like O(logN) only for dimensions D≥2 and that random circuits require O(√N) depth for D=1. Finally, we introduce an “expurgation” algorithm that uses quantum measurements to remove logical operators that cause the code to fail by turning them into either additional stabilizers or into gauge operators in a subsystem code. With such targeted measurements, we can achieve sublogarithmic depth in D≥2 spatial dimensions below capacity without increasing the maximum weight of the check operators. We find that for any rate beneath the capacity, high-performing codes with thousands of logical qubits are achievable with depth 4–8 expurgated random circuits in D=2 dimensions.

Given an arbitrary binary matrix, we can derive a pair of A1 and A2 by the relation. As examples, we illustrate two kinds of stabilizer codes: quantum LDPC codes and quantum convolutional codes. By the nature of the proposed framework, the stabilizer codes covered in this paper belong to general stabilizer (non-CSS) codes.},

This paper fills in the gap by proposing five systematic constructions for non-CSS stabilizer codes, the first four of which are based on classic binary quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and last on classic binary LDPC-convolutional codes. These new constructions exploit structured sparse graphs, make essential use of simple and powerful coding techniques including concatenation, rotation and scrambling, and generate rich classes of codes with a wide range of lengths and rates. We derive the sufficient, and in some cases also the necessary, conditions for each construction to satisfy the general symplectic inner product (SIP) condition, and develop practical decoder algorithms for these codes. The resulting codes are the first classes of non-CSS quantum LDPC codes and non-CSS quantum convolutional codes rooted from classic binary codes (rather than codes in GF(4)), and some of them perform as well as or better than the existing quantum codes.},

	abstract = {A method is proposed, called channel polarization, to construct code sequences that achieve the symmetric capacity I(W) of any given binary-input discrete memoryless channel (B-DMC) W. The symmetric capacity is the highest rate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal probability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to synthesize, out of N independent copies of a given B-DMC W, a second set of N binary-input channels WN(i)1 les i les N such that, as N becomes large, the fraction of indices i for which I(WN(i)) is near 1 approaches I(W) and the fraction for which I(WN(i)) is near 0 approaches 1-I(W). The polarized channels WN(i) are well-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate 1 through those with capacity near 1 and at rate 0 through the remaining. Codes constructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes. The paper proves that, given any B-DMC W with I(W) {\textgreater} 0 and any target rate R{\textless} I(W) there exists a sequence of polar codes Cfrn;nges1 such that Cfrn has block-length N=2n , rate ges R, and probability of block error under successive cancellation decoding bounded as Pe(N,R) les O(N-1/4) independently of the code rate. This performance is achievable by encoders and decoders with complexity O(N logN) for each.},

	abstract = {Quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers known as LDPC codes have been actively studied recently due to their potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, all families of quantum LDPC codes known to this date suffer from a poor distance scaling limited by the square-root of the code length. This is in a sharp contrast with the classical case where good families of LDPC codes are known that combine constant encoding rate and linear distance. Here we propose the first family of good quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers. The new codes have a constant encoding rate, linear distance, and stabilizers acting on at most O(√n) qubits, where n is the code length. For comparison, all previously known families of good quantum codes have stabilizers of linear weight. Our proof combines two techniques: randomized constructions of good quantum codes and the homological product operation from algebraic topology. We conjecture that similar methods can produce good stabilizer codes with stabilizer weight O(nα) for any α {\textgreater} 0.},

We then show that the well known bounded degree cosystolic expanders, the Ramanujan complexes are, in fact, collective cosystolic expanders. This enables us to construct new bounded degree cosystolic expanders, by tensoring of Ramanujan complexes. Using our new constructed bounded degree cosystolic expanders we construct \{{\textbackslash}em explicit\} quantum LDPC codes of distance \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\} {\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}k n\$ for any \$k\$, improving a recent result of Evra et. al. {\textbackslash}cite\{EKZ\}, and setting a new record for distance of explicit quantum LDPC codes.

	title = {Exponential suppression of bit or phase flip errors with repetitive error correction},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06132},
	abstract = {Realizing the potential of quantum computing will require achieving sufficiently low logical error rates. Many applications call for error rates in the \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ regime, but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have physical error rates near \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. Quantum error correction (QEC) promises to bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits so that errors can be detected and corrected. Logical errors are then exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold. QEC also requires that the errors are local and that performance is maintained over many rounds of error correction, two major outstanding experimental challenges. Here, we implement 1D repetition codes embedded in a 2D grid of superconducting qubits which demonstrate exponential suppression of bit or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round by more than \$100{\textbackslash}times\$ when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analyzing error correlations with high precision, and characterize the locality of errors in a device performing QEC for the first time. Finally, we perform error detection using a small 2D surface code logical qubit on the same device, and show that the results from both 1D and 2D codes agree with numerical simulations using a simple depolarizing error model. These findings demonstrate that superconducting qubits are on a viable path towards fault tolerant quantum computing.},

We propose a 2D layout for quantum LDPC codes by decomposing their Tanner graphs into a small number of planar layers. Each layer contains long-range connections which do not cross. For any CSS code with a degree-\${\textbackslash}delta\$ Tanner graph, we design stabilizer measurement circuits with depth at most \$(2{\textbackslash}delta +2)\$ using at most \${\textbackslash}lceil {\textbackslash}delta/2 {\textbackslash}rceil\$ layers. We observe a circuit-noise threshold of 0.28{\textbackslash}\% for a positive-rate code family using 49 physical qubits per logical qubit. For a physical error rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$, this family reaches a logical error rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ using fourteen times fewer physical qubits than the surface code.},

Taking a product of a large graph with a small graph, the resulting graph inherits (roughly) its size from the large one, its degree from the small one, and its expansion properties from both! Iteration yields simple explicit constructions of constant-degree expanders of arbitrary size, starting from one constant-size expander. Crucial to our intuition (and simple analysis) of the properties of this graph product is the view of expanders as functions which act as "entropy wave" propagators - they transform probability distributions in which entropy is concentrated in one area to distributions where that concentration is dissipated. In these terms, the graph product affords the constructive interference of two such waves. Subsequent work [ALW01], [MW01] relates the zig-zag product of graphs to the standard semidirect product of groups, leading to new results and constructions on expanding Cayley graphs.},

In this paper, a new class of quantum LDPC codes based on lines and points of finite geometries is constructed. The parity check matrices of these codes are adapted to be self- orthogonal with containing only one cycle of length four in each pair of two rows. Also, the column and row weights, and bounds on the minimum distance of these codes are given. As a consequence, these codes can be encoded using shift-register encoding algorithms and can be decoded using iterative decoding algorithms over various quantum depolarizing channels.},

In these codes, qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z\_2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures.},

Lower bounds to the rate and the minimum distance of the new code are derived in terms of the parameters of the graph and the subeodes. Both the encoders and decoders proposed are shown to take advantage of the code's explicit decomposition into subcodes to decompose and simplify the associated computational processes. Bounds on the performance of two specific decoding algorithms are established, and the asymptotic growth of the complexity of decoding for two types of codes and decoders is analyzed. The proposed decoders are able to make effective use of probabilistic information supplied by the channel receiver, e.g., reliability information, without greatly increasing the number of computations required. It is shown that choosing a transmission order for the digits that is appropriate for the graph and the subcodes can give the code excellent burst-error correction abilities.

	abstract = {We present a general method for determining the capacity of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes under message-passing decoding when used over any binary-input memoryless channel with discrete or continuous output alphabets. Transmitting at rates below this capacity, a randomly chosen element of the given ensemble will achieve an arbitrarily small target probability of error with a probability that approaches one exponentially fast in the length of the code. (By concatenating with an appropriate outer code one can achieve a probability of error that approaches zero exponentially fast in the length of the code with arbitrarily small loss in rate.) Conversely, transmitting at rates above this capacity the probability of error is bounded away from zero by a strictly positive constant which is independent of the length of the code and of the number of iterations performed. Our results are based on the observation that the concentration of the performance of the decoder around its average performance, as observed by Luby et al. in the case of a binary-symmetric channel and a binary message-passing algorithm, is a general phenomenon. For the particularly important case of belief-propagation decoders, we provide an effective algorithm to determine the corresponding capacity to any desired degree of accuracy. The ideas presented in this paper are broadly applicable and extensions of the general method to low-density parity-check codes over larger alphabets, turbo codes, and other concatenated coding schemes are outlined.},

	abstract = {The Counting Constraint Satisfaction Problem (\#CSP) can be expressed as follows: given a set of variables, a set of values that can be taken by the variables, and a set of constraints specifying some restrictions on the values that can be taken simultaneously by some variables, determine the number of assignments of values to variables that satisfy all the constraints. The \#CSP provides a general framework for numerous counting combinatorial problems including counting satisfying assignments to a propositional formula, counting graph homomorphisms, graph reliability and many others. This problem can be parametrized by the set of relations that may appear in a constraint. In this paper we start a systematic study of subclasses of the \#CSP restricted in this way. The ultimate goal of this investigation is to distinguish those restricted subclasses of the \#CSP which are solvable in polynomial time from those which are not. We show that the complexity of any restricted \#CSP class on a finite domain can be deduced from the properties of polymorphisms of the allowed constraints, similar to that for the decision constraint satisfaction problem. Then we prove that if a subclass of the \#CSP is solvable in polynomial time, then constraints allowed by the class satisfy some very restrictive condition: they need to have a Mal’tsev polymorphism, that is a ternary operation m(x,y,z) such that m(x,y,y)=m(y,y,x)=x. This condition uniformly explains many existing complexity results for particular cases of the \#CSP, including the dichotomy results for the problem of counting graph homomorphisms, and it allows us to obtain new results.},

Attempts to solve this problem are known from Boolean factor analysis where I is interpreted as an object–attribute matrix, A and B are interpreted as object–factor and factor–attribute matrices, and the aim is to find a decomposition with a small number k of factors. The method presented here is based on a theorem proved in this paper. It says that optimal decompositions, i.e. those with the least number of factors possible, are those where factors are formal concepts in the sense of formal concept analysis. Finding an optimal decomposition is an NP-hard problem. However, we present an approximation algorithm for finding optimal decompositions which is based on the insight provided by the theorem. The algorithm avoids the need to compute all formal concepts and significantly outperforms a greedy approximation algorithm for a set covering problem to which the problem of matrix decomposition is easily shown to be reducible. We present results of several experiments with various data sets including those from CIA World Factbook and UCI Machine Learning Repository. In addition, we present further geometric insight including description of transformations between the space of attributes and the space of factors.},

Codes of these four classes have good minimum distances and their Tanner (1981) graphs have girth 6. Finite-geometry LDPC codes can be decoded in various ways, ranging from low to high decoding complexity and from reasonably good to very good performance. They perform very well with iterative decoding. Furthermore, they can be put in either cyclic or quasi-cyclic form. Consequently, their encoding can be achieved in linear time and implemented with simple feedback shift registers. This advantage is not shared by other LDPC codes in general and is important in practice. Finite-geometry LDPC codes can be extended and shortened in various ways to obtain other good LDPC codes. Several techniques of extension and shortening are presented. Long extended finite-geometry LDPC codes have been constructed and they achieve a performance only a few tenths of a decibel away from the Shannon theoretical limit with iterative decoding.},

	abstract = {In this letter, we obtain lower and upper bounds on the minimum distance dmin of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The bounds are derived by categorizing the non-zero code words of an LDPC code into two categories of elementary and non-elementary. The first category contains code words whose induced subgraph has only degree-2 check nodes. We propose an efficient search algorithm that can find the elementary code words of an LDPC code with weight less than a certain value amax, exhaustively. We also derive a lower bound Lne on the weight of non-elementary code words. By performing the search with amax = Lne, we either obtain an elementary code word with the smallest weight dmin, or establish the lower bound of Lne on dmin. For the upper bound, we modify our search algorithm to reach elementary codewords of larger weights at the cost of being non-exhaustive. Once such a codeword is found, its weight acts as an upper bound on dmin. We examine a large number of regular and irregular LDPC codes, and demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our technique in finding lower and upper bounds on, and in many cases the exact value of, dmin. Finding dmin, or establishing search-based lower or upper bounds, for many of the examined codes are out of the reach of any existing algorithm.},

We next describe how logical qubits are formed in the surface code array and give numerical estimates of their fault tolerance. We outline how logical qubits are physically moved on the array, how qubit braid transformations are constructed, and how a braid between two logical qubits is equivalent to a controlled-not. We then describe the single-qubit Hadamard, ˆS and ˆT operators, completing the set of required gates for a universal quantum computer.

Our formalism, however, preserves positivity of the tensors at every step and hence yields an interpretation in terms of Hamiltonian flows. We emphasize that the key difference between tensor network approaches and Kadanoff’s spin blocking method can be understood in terms of a change of the local basis at every decimation step, a property which is crucial to overcome the area law of mutual information. We derive algebraic relations for fixed point tensors, calculate critical exponents, and benchmark our method on the Ising model and the six-vertex model.},

Its tensor network description allows for exact contraction through simple diagrammatic rewrite rules. The contraction property does not depend on specifics such as geometry, but rather originates from the non-trivial algebraic properties of the constituent tensors. We then generalise the resulting tensor network from a spin-1/2 lattice to a class of exactly contractible states on spin-S degrees of freedom, yielding the most efficient tensor network description of finite Abelian lattice gauge theories. We gain a new perspective on these states as examples of two-dimensional quantum states with algebraically contractible tensor network representations. The introduction of local perturbations to the network is shown to reduce the von Neumann entropy of string-like regions, creating an unentangled sub-system within the bulk in a certain limit. We also show how local perturbations induce finite-range correlations in this system. This class of tensor networks is readily translated onto any lattice, and we differentiate between the physical consequences of bipartite and non-bipartite lattices on the properties of the corresponding quantum states. We explicitly show this on the hexagonal, square, kagome and triangular lattices.},

We then describe and analyze a number of methods for determining a balanced vertex-ordering, obtaining optimal orderings for directed acyclic graphs, trees, and graphs with maximum degree three. For undirected graphs, we obtain a 13/8-approximation algorithm. Finally we consider the problem of determining a balanced vertex-ordering of a bipartite graph with a fixed ordering of one bipartition. When only the imbalances of the fixed vertices count, this problem is shown to be NP-hard. On the other hand, we describe an optimal linear time algorithm when the final imbalances of all vertices count.

We discuss how quantum computers can augment classical computer simulations used to probe these reaction mechanisms, to significantly increase their accuracy and enable hitherto intractable simulations. Our resource estimates show that, even when taking into account the substantial overhead of quantum error correction, and the need to compile into discrete gate sets, the necessary computations can be performed in reasonable time on small quantum computers.

	abstract = {State preparation protocols ideally require as minimal operations as possible in order to be implemented in near-term, potentially noisy quantum devices. Motivated by long-range interactions (LRIs) intrinsic to many present-day experimental platforms (trapped ions, Rydberg atom arrays, etc.), we investigate the efficacy of variationally simulating nontrivial quantum states using the variational quantum-classical simulation (VQCS) protocol explored recently [W. W. Ho and T. H. Hsieh, SciPost Phys. 6, 29 (2019)], in the presence of LRIs. We show that this approach leads to extremely efficient state preparation: for example, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be prepared with O(1) iterations of the protocol, and a quantum critical point of the long-range transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) can be prepared with {\textgreater}99\% fidelity on a 100-qubit system with only one iteration. Furthermore, we show that VQCS with LRIs is a promising route for exploring generic points in the phase diagram of the long-range TFIM. Our approach thus provides concrete, ultrafast protocols for quantum simulators equipped with long-range interactions.},

	abstract = {Building a quantum computer with a one-dimensional (1D) architecture, instead of the typical two-dimensional (2D) layout, could be significantly less difficult experimentally. However such a restricted topology necessitates a large overhead for shuffling qubits and consequently the fault tolerance threshold is far lower than in 2D architectures. Here we identify a middle ground: a 1D segmented chain which is a linear array of segments, each of which is a well-connected zone with all-to-all connectivity. The architecture is relevant to both ion trap and solid-state systems. We establish that fault tolerance can be achieved either by a surface code alone, or via an additional concatenated four-qubit gauge code. We find that the fault tolerance threshold is 0.12\%, a feasible error rate with today’s technology, using 15-qubit segments, while larger segments are superior. For 35 or more qubits per segment one can achieve computation on a meaningful scale with today’s state-of-the-art fidelities without the use of the upper concatenation layer, thus minimising the overall device size.},

In all such cases it is easy to derive upper bounds on the location of the threshold by showing that above a certain density the first moment (expectation) of the number of solutions tends to zero. We show that in the case of certain symmetric constraints, considering the second moment of the number of solutions yields nearly matching lower bounds for the location of the threshold. Specifically, we prove that the threshold for both random hypergraph 2‐colorability (Property B) and random Not‐All‐Equal k‐SAT is \$2{\textasciicircum}\{k-1\}{\textbackslash}ln 2 -O(1)\$. As a corollary, we establish that the threshold for random k‐SAT is of order \${\textbackslash}Theta(2{\textasciicircum}k)\$, resolving a long‐standing open problem.},

A transistor, despite its roots in energy band structure, does not invoke quantum mechanically coherent transmission between terminals. The impressive progress in the past decade in mesoscopic physics, when combined with studies that have analysed a totally quantum mechanical computational process, suggest that we may be ready to move toward more quantum mechanical procedures for information processing. This paper is a warning signal; this possibility is beset by problems. The case will be made via two separate but complementary arguments. First, by summarizing this author's published comments on computation via totally quantum mechanical coherent Hamiltonians. The computation is likely to suffer from localization, i.e. from reflection of the computational trajectory, causing the computation to turn around. Additionally, small errors will accumulate and cause the computation to go off track. This is supplemented by analysis of specific proposals that suggest more detailed machinery than invoked in the general literature on quantum mechanical Hamiltonian computation.},

Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.},

	abstract = {Quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a promising avenue to reduce the cost of constructing scalable quantum circuits. However, it is unclear how to implement these codes in practice. Seminal results of Bravyi \& Terhal, and Bravyi, Poulin \& Terhal have shown that quantum LDPC codes implemented through local interactions obey restrictions on their dimension \$k\$ and distance \$d\$. Here we address the complementary question of how many long-range interactions are required to implement a quantum LDPC code with parameters \$k\$ and \$d\$. In particular, in 2D we show that a quantum LDPC with distance \$n{\textasciicircum}\{1/2 + {\textbackslash}epsilon\}\$ code requires \${\textbackslash}Omega(n{\textasciicircum}\{1/2 + {\textbackslash}epsilon\})\$ interactions of length \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon\})\$. Further a code satisfying \$k {\textbackslash}propto n\$ with distance \$d {\textbackslash}propto n{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha\$ requires \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}(n)\$ interactions of length \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha/2\})\$. Our results are derived using bounds on quantum codes from graph metrics. As an application of these results, we consider a model called a stacked architecture, which has previously been considered as a potential way to implement quantum LDPC codes. In this model, although most interactions are local, a few of them are allowed to be very long. We prove that limited long-range connectivity implies quantitative bounds on the distance and code dimension.},

We apply this construction to the specific case of the product of a surface code with a small code such as a \$[[4,2,2]]\$ code, which we call an augmented surface code. The distance of the augmented surface code is the product of the distance of the surface code with that of the small code, and the union-find decoder, with slight modifications, can decode errors up to half the distance. We present numerical simulations, showing that while the threshold of these augmented codes is lower than that of the surface code, the low noise performance is improved.},

Our building block is a special type of tensor with maximal entanglement along any bipartition, which gives rise to an isometry from the bulk Hilbert space to the boundary Hilbert space. The entire tensor network is an encoder for a quantum error-correcting code, where the bulk and boundary degrees of freedom may be identified as logical and physical degrees of freedom respectively. These models capture key features of entanglement in the AdS/CFT correspondence; in particular, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the negativity of tripartite information are obeyed exactly in many cases. That bulk logical operators can be represented on multiple boundary regions mimics the Rindlerwedge reconstruction of boundary operators from bulk operators, realizing explicitly the quantum error-correcting features of AdS/CFT recently proposed in [1].},

	abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit—that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of controlled-NOT (CNOT), Hadamard, and phase gates—can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor of 2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ⊕L, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a “canonical form” that requires at most O(n2/logn) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of nonstabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.},

The type system supports abstract and recursive objects, and is expressive enough to accommodate several standard benchmarks with only minor workarounds. The invariants enforced by the types enable an ahead-of-time compiler to carry out optimizations typically beyond the reach of static compilers for dynamic languages. Unlike previous inference techniques for prototype inheritance, our algorithm uses a combination of lower and upper bound propagation to infer types and discover type errors in all code, including uninvoked functions. The inference is expressed in a simple constraint language, designed to leverage off-the-shelf fixed point solvers. We prove soundness for both the type system and inference algorithm. An experimental evaluation showed that the inference is powerful, handling the aforementioned benchmarks with no manual type annotation, and that the inferred types enable effective static compilation.},

While such problems become extraordinarily hard to solve by local search methods in a large region of the parameter space, still at least one solution may be superimposed by construction. The statistical properties of the model can be studied exactly by the replica method and each single instance can be analyzed in polynomial time by a simple global solution method. The geometrical and topological structures responsible for dynamic and static phase transitions as well as for the onset of computational complexity in the local search method are thoroughly analyzed. Numerical analysis on very large samples allows for a precise characterization of the critical scaling behavior.},

Recent universal hashing-based approaches to sampling and counting crucially depend on the runtime performance of SAT solvers on formulas expressed as the conjunction of both \$k\$-CNF and XOR constraints (known as \$k\$-CNF-XOR formulas), but the behavior of random \$k\$-CNF-XOR formulas is unexplored in prior work. In this paper, we present the first study of the satisfiability of random \$k\$-CNF-XOR formulas. We show empirical evidence of a surprising phase-transition that follows a linear trade-off between \$k\$-CNF and XOR constraints. Furthermore, we prove that a phase-transition for \$k\$-CNF-XOR formulas exists for \$k = 2\$ and (when the number of \$k\$-CNF constraints is small) for \$k {\textgreater} 2\$.},

From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second.

	abstract = {A rigorous definition of crosstalk errors is given, and a protocol for detecting and localizing them is constructed, which is highly efficient, in the sense that the number of unique experiments required scales at most cubically, and very often quadratically, with theNumber of qubits. Crosstalk occurs in most quantum computing systems with more than one qubit. It can cause a variety of correlated and nonlocal crosstalk errors that can be especially harmful to fault-tolerant quantum error correction, which generally relies on errors being local and relatively predictable. Mitigating crosstalk errors requires understanding, modeling, and detecting them. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive framework for crosstalk errors and a protocol for detecting and localizing them. We give a rigorous definition of crosstalk errors that captures a wide range of disparate physical phenomena that have been called "crosstalk", and a concrete model for crosstalk-free quantum processors. Errors that violate this model are crosstalk errors. Next, we give an equivalent but purely operational (model-independent) definition of crosstalk errors. Using this definition, we construct a protocol for detecting a large class of crosstalk errors in a multi-qubit processor by finding conditional dependencies between observed experimental probabilities. It is highly efficient, in the sense that the number of unique experiments required scales at most cubically, and very often quadratically, with the number of qubits. We demonstrate the protocol using simulations of 2-qubit and 6-qubit processors.},

Our analysis reveals that crosstalk can be of the same order of gate error which is considered a dominant error in NISQ devices. We also propose adversarial fault injection using crosstalk in a multiprogramming environment where the victim and the adversary share the same quantum hardware. Our simulation and experimental results from IBM quantum computers demonstrated that the adversary can inject fault and launch a Denial-of-Service attack.

The theory of quantum error-correcting codes has some close ties to and some striking differences from the theory of classical error-correcting codes. Many quantum codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The stabilizer is a finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the finite field with four elements. To build a quantum computer which behaves correctly in the presence of errors, we also need a theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation, instructing us how to perform quantum gates on qubits which are encoded in a quantum error-correcting code. The threshold theorem states that it is possible to create a quantum computer to perform an arbitrary quantum computation provided the error rate per physical gate or time step is below some constant threshold value.},
